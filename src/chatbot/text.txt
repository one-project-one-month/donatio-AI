Valorant is a free-to-play 5v5 tactical first-person shooter (FPS) developed and published by Riot Games. Released officially on June 2, 2020, it's available on Windows, with a console version (PS5, Xbox Series X/S) launched in 2024 (though PC and console do not share cross-play to ensure fairness).

The game combines precise gunplay (similar to CS:GO) with unique character abilities (inspired by Overwatch), creating a fast-paced yet highly strategic competitive experience.

Core Mode (Unrated/Competitive): Attackers try to plant the Spike (a bomb), and defenders attempt to stop or defuse it. First to 13 rounds wins.

Economy System: Each player earns money per round to buy weapons and abilities.

Abilities + Gunplay: Each Agent has a set of abilities (including an Ultimate), but success still heavily relies on accurate shooting.

As of 2025, Valorant features 25+ Agents across 4 roles:

Role	Description	Examples
Duelist	Fraggers meant to lead attacks	Jett, Reyna, Phoenix
Initiator	Disrupt defenses and gather intel	Sova, Skye, KAY/O
Controller	Control space with smokes or zones	Omen, Brimstone, Viper
Sentinel	Defensive support, good for locking sites	Sage, Cypher, Killjoy
